# Erlang Guidelines

This project follows [Inaka's Erlang
guidelines](https://github.com/inaka/erlang_guidelines).

Rules are not applied strictly, and the main rule is [maintaining the
existing
style](https://github.com/inaka/erlang_guidelines#maintain-existing-style):

> When editing a module written by someone else, stick to the style in
  which it was written. If a project has an overall style, stick to
  that when writing new modules as well.

Some of the guidelines are codified as [editor-agnostic
configuration](http://editorconfig.org/) in the `.editorconfig` file.
